        <h1 class="post-title">First year of college in Velenje</h1>
        <p class="date">Posted 10.05.2016 by Gregor Novak.</p>
        <p class="article">The first year of college was more or less repeating the same stuff that most
        of students who went to a computer engineer high school learned already.
        But for students like me (i went to an electrical high school) everything was new and if we wanted to pass every
        exam, we had to do much more then others. Like with everything in the world
        the basics are the most important thing, because if you don't know them you
        have no chance in succeding in the field that you are. Ofcourse passing exams
        doesn't really matter if you don't like this field or you forget everything
        after the exam.</p>
        <p class="article">When i applied for this college i didn't know what i
        want to do in my life, nothing was interesting, didn't have any desires.
        For the most part i didn't have any problems, except when we started programming.
        When we were doing lessons in Java programming language i was struggling
        with everything, it was just too much for me. After all the lessons in 2
        semester i said to myself that i have no shot at passing this exam, so i
        did what i should have done long before. I started practicing at home and
        soon enough i understood everything, i finally started to believe that i
        can be in this field and do what i love for work, which is very important for me.</p>
        <p class="article">And everything else went from there, the first thing that
        changed everything was the believe that i can work in this field, the second
        thing was the drive, the thing in the back of your head which is telling you
        don't know enough and that you should be practicing and learning every
        day for the rest of your life, because you cannot stay still in this field,
        otherwise you will finish your career alot sooner then you though.</p>
        <p class="article">Oh and the smell of coal in Sostanj, just brightens our day up
        when we drive to college.</p>
